(moved from 20 August 2015 notes...)

1.1
- added definition of undecidable and name of halting problem to introductory
  text (as before, we just want them to recognize the name, not do the proof,
  as was stated in the previous version of the notes).
- marked sections as optional

1.2
- added examples illustrating distribution of modulus over addition and
  multiplication
- added examples of patterns generated using the algebraic approach to
  finding 2's complement representations of negative numbers

1.5 ==> MOVED TO PART 4

1.6 ==> became 1.5 (didn't change)

1.7 ==> became 1.6
- removed "Turing machines" as term for recognition
- removed "intractable" also (left "undecidable")
- removed all learning objectives based on 1.5 (error detection and correction)



11 December 2016
- moved 3.3 (FSM Examples, Part II) back behind 3.5 (Extending Keyless
  Entry); these examples are usually not covered, but make use of 
  components, while extending keyless entry with a counter is meant to 
  be the first component-based FSM design 

30 November 2016
- edited microprogrammed control unit design figures in Section 4.1
  to reflect changes needed to retain 5-bit state design while 
  fixing P&P's JSRR bug; STILL NEED TO UPDATE TEXT!

11 January 2017
- updated Sections 3.8 and 4.4 to reflect movement of LC-3 ISA into 
  part 3 of the course, as we have been teaching it (and including it
  in midterm 3)
- fixed typos
- adjusted control unit design to make use of datapath modification
  to support execution of JSR(R) with one state, which reduces state
  count below 32 for the micorprogrammed design
  FIXME: I need to get the latest copy of P&P's Figure C.2: the web page
  still has the old version

(Spring 2017 release)

19 August 2020
- fixed typos in 3.1.3 Finite State Machines section
- added \equiv notation for modular arithmetic equivalence (1.2.3) and
  edited text a bit
- added credits section for 3.3; contacted all involved to affirm wording;
  only Geoffrey and Kirill didn't answer

25 September 2020
- fixed typo in 2.3.3 (use of C_out in S expression)

(Fall 2020 release)

3 December 2021
- removed master-slave terminology from 2.6 and 2.8
- added introductory comments about offensive terminology

10 January 2022
- finalized introductory comments about offensive terminology
- removed another instance from 2.6.6
